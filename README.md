## Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning
This project implements an end-to-end predictive maintenance system to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan aircraft engines using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
The solution leverages time-series sensor data, feature engineering, and LSTM neural networks to model degradation patterns and predict engine failure cycles.
